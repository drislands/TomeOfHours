Graphical utility for interfacing with database

use SQLite for local DB

allow insertion of items of varying types

want to enable the ability to create categories, such as Tool and Candle

don't want to include categories by default

Should be able to highlight text in descriptions and create links, like in Obsidian MD


goal is to say "get me all memories that can come from books and have Rose" and have a list of interactive results,
  sorted by how much Rose they have and whether they require a language to read
